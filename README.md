Operating-Systems-Final-Project
===============================

Final Project of our simulation of an OS for the course Operating Systems Fundamentals (60-330) at the University of Windsor.

The group consists of:
John Lam, Kyle Petrozzi, Ryan Shaw and Natalie Betts

The core components of the project is to demostrate:

  5-State Process Model (Ryan Shaw) - 
    The 5-state process model described in textbook and lectures in the base of this project.
    
  Job Submission (Natalie Betts)
    ·   Job submission header file
    
  Machine Architecture 
    ·   RAM model for user processes
    ·   CPU functionality
    ·   I/O devices
    ·   You may design your own system clock functionality
    
  Process and Resource tables; Queues and Management (Ryan Shaw)
    ·   Resource management tables
    ·   Device management tables
    ·   A 5-state queueing model
    ·   Queue management
    
  Scheduling (Kyle Petrozzi)
    ·   Short term and Long term
    ·   Round-Robin, FCFS, SJF, Priority
    ·   Deadlock avoidance/prevention may be implemented
    
  User Processes Synchronization and Simulation (John Lam)
    ·   Simulation of single process execution
    ·   Multiprogramming support and management
    ·   Synchronization and Critical Sections
    ·   Peterson Solution to critical sections
    
  User Interface and Reporting (Natalie Betts)
    ·   Command line interface
    ·   Reporting summary statistics gathered during simulation run
    ·   Comparative statistics for various scheduling using two or more different algorithms
